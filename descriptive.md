# Descriptive Statistics on Social Media vs Productivity Dataset
## 📊 Project Overview
This project explores **descriptive statistics** using a real-world dataset titled **"Social Media vs Productivity"**. The primary objective is to understand the relationship between digital habits—such as screen time, social media usage, and notifications—and outcomes like productivity, stress levels, and overall well-being.

The notebook walks through the process of summarizing, visualizing, and interpreting the dataset using Python libraries. This type of analysis helps in forming hypotheses, detecting patterns, and guiding further statistical or machine learning models.

## 🗂 Dataset Description
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes the following features:

-Social Media Usage: Time spent daily on various platforms.

-Screen Time: Total time using digital devices.

-Notifications Received: Count of daily push notifications.

-Productivity Levels: Self-reported productivity.

-Stress and Well-being Indicators: User feedback on stress and mental health.

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries Used
-Python: Core programming language

-Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning

-NumPy: Numerical computations

-Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization

-Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for exploratory analysis

## 📌 Key Tasks Performed
-Data loading and exploration

-Handling missing values

-Summary statistics: mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation

-Data visualization: histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps

-Insights and interpretations of trends in the dataset

## 🔍 Insights Gained
-Correlation patterns between screen time and productivity

-Distribution of stress levels across different user groups

-Relationship between notification frequency and perceived well-being
